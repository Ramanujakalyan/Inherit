# Machine Learning: Basis functions, kernels(1) and kernels(2) 

2014-02,  Dr. Skippy

A gentle introduction to the concepts of the nonlinear models with Logistic Regression and SVMs, basis expansion, smoothing kernels, kernel methods in machine learning and a hint at connections.

This session was built using: 

- Python 2.7.9 
- IPython 2.3 
- numpy 1.9
- matplotlib 1.4
- scikit-learn 0.15.2

If you want to explore the IPython Notebook without running Python on your own machine, you can also view it (without the output) at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DrSkippy/Data-Science-45min-Intros/blob/master/ml-basis-expansion-101/Basis Expansion.ipynb).
