Python tools for social network analysis
========================================

Fiona Pigott
------------

This is a simple ipython notebook that explains how to use igraph, igraph plotting tools, and matplotlib for analysis of social graphs.
The notebook explains basic commands/ syntax in igraph-python, shows how to use igraph-python for real data, and touches on some concepts about networks and social graph networks such as small-world networks, communitites, and associativity. 

Graphs for the "real data" section at the end of the notebook can be found at fiona/home/2014-05-27_user_graphs/data/output_graphs, but that data isn't necessasry for most of the notebook.
