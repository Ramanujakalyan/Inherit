# Intro to ``pandas``

2013-12-16, Josh Montague


A short introduction to some of the functionality in the [``pandas``](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Python library. ``pandas`` provides high-performance data structures and analysis tools, notably the ``Series`` (1-dimensional) and ``DataFrame`` (2-dimensional). This notebook works through some of the ``pandas`` API for creating data structures from external files, manipulating these structures (slicing, "melting"), and also plotting data from them. The ``pandas`` API includes helper functions that are connected to the ``matplotlib`` API for fast and easy simple plots.
