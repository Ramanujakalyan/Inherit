# Intro to ``scikit-learn``

2014-04-04, Josh Montague


A short and basic introduction to the ``sklearn`` API interface and a couple of very simple examples of using an estimator on some built-in sample data (k-nearest neighbors and linear regression).  

This session was built using: 

- Python 2.7 
- IPython 1.2
- matplotlib 1.3
- numpy 1.8
- sklearn 0.14

The capability of the full [``sklearn`` package](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is pretty mind-blowing; this Notebook aims for the lowest hanging fruit, because the same framework is used for the advanced use-cases. This is certainly one of the strengths of ``sklearn``. Note that these materials do not go into explaining *what* the various estimators are doing or how the algorithm works. For those discussions, definitely see the other materials in [this repository](https://github.com/DrSkippy27/Data-Science-45min-Intros) and the [official documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html).

The majority of this material was collected by combining pieces of the official docs (which are possibly the pinnacle of package documentation) and assorted other online materials. Instead of replicating a bunch of awesome information here, I'll suggest you read the [Quick Start](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html) and as much of the [tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/index.html) as you like before getting started with this. 

If you want to explore the IPython Notebook without running Python on your own machine, you can also view it at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DrSkippy27/Data-Science-45min-Intros/blob/master/sklearn-101/sklearn-101.ipynb).

Enjoy!
