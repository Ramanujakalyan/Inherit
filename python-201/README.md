# Intermediate Python Concepts 

This is the start of a collection of intermediate\* concepts in the Python programming language. While the focus is likely to be around concepts that develop skills relevant to data science and analysis-based projects, some of these concepts should be helpful for anyone writing Python, regardless of the purpose.

The current list of covered topics is below:

\* intermediate is admittedly subjective. Here, I'm referring to things that I didn't know for quite a while in my own experience with Python (all while happily building data projects!).
