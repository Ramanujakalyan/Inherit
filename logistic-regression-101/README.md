#Builder up Logistic Regression from the basics


2013, Scott Hendrickson

A short introduction to Logistic Regression. We build up the basic pieces with simple arguments and end up with a basic classifier that is simple to understand and very fast to run on some toy problems. In the end, you want to use Scikit Learn.

This session was built using: 

- Python 2.7 
- IPython 1.x
- numpy 1.7
- matplotlib 1.2
- pandas 0.9.1 


-----

The capability of the full [``sklearn`` package](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is pretty mind-blowing; this Notebook aims for the lowest hanging fruit, because the same framework is used for the advanced use-cases. This is certainly one of the strengths of ``sklearn``. Note that these materials do not go into explaining *what* the various estimators are doing or how the algorithm works. For those discussions, definitely see the other materials in [this repository](https://github.com/DrSkippy27/Data-Science-45min-Intros) and the [official documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html).

If you want to explore the IPython Notebook without running Python on your own machine, you can also view it at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DrSkippy27/Data-Science-45min-Intros/blob/master/sklearn-101/sklearn-101.ipynb).

Enjoy!
