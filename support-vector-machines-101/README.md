# Introduction to support vector machines (SVMs) 

2014-02, Josh Montague

A gentle introduction to the concepts of the support vector machine (SVM), starting from regularized logistic regression. 

This session was built using: 

- Python 2.7.9 
- IPython 2.3 
- numpy 1.9
- matplotlib 1.4
- pandas 0.15
- seaborn 0.5

If you want to explore the IPython Notebook without running Python on your own machine, you can also view it (without the output) at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DrSkippy/Data-Science-45min-Intros/blob/master/support-vector-machines/intro-svm.ipynb).

Enjoy!
